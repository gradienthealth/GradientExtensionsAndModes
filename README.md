# GradientExtensionsAndModes

## Getting Started
These modes are published as private npm repos which and install via the OHIF
`yarn cli add-extension` and `yarn cli add-mode` commands.

## Development
You can develop these extensions live by linking them. Within each extension and mode
you can link via `yarn link`. Then within your OHIF viewer you can run 
`yarn link <name-of-package>`.
